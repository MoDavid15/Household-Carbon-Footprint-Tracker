# Household-Carbon-Footprint-Tracker
Tracks individual household carbon footprints both in a per-household and community-based manner.

Our program is a prototype for a household carbon footprint tracker. It tracks the electrical and water consumption of a community based on server input and transportation
based on user input. It calculates the carbon footprint generated by an individual household. 

To use the program, input a username and password so you can save your data. 
The program will then determine your location and will provide electrical and water data on neighboring households.

The program will automatically calculate the carbon footprint generated per day and display this on your screen.
